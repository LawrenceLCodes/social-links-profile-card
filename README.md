## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS hover, focus states
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was similiar to the previous blog preview card however, I did run into a small issue where the clickable a tag was smaller than the full button area as per the design.

### Continued development

No immediate plans for additional features or functionality; however I am open to feedback or suggestions for improvement.

### Useful resources

- [Clickable Area Resource](https://ishadeed.com/article/clickable-area/) - This is the site I found which helped me increase the clickable area of the social media a tags. I have saved this link and will be adding this to my personal repository for buttons and clickable links.
